# AngularMicroFrontendsApp

Hi, in this repository I'm going to practice configuration of MicroFrontends with Angular.

For work, I used
manual https://www.angulararchitects.io/blog/the-microfrontend-revolution-part-2-module-federation-with-angular/, and
another ones.

In this project I plan to create application consists from 3 apps.

1. Contents app.
2. Musicians board.
3. Musician library.

Sure, it's not even close to real size of MicroFrontends application, but the goal of this repository, is build
configuration for MicroFrontend apps with Angular close to real life.

Have a good day.
